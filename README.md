# Description

This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems in various programming languages made by me. Please note that these solutions may not be the best or optimal solutions to the problems. They are simply one approach to solving the problem and may not necessarily be the most efficient solution.

# Usage

Each solution is contained within a separate folder, named according to the problem's title on LeetCode. Within each folder, you will find a file named ```app.*``` which contains the code for the solution.

To use a solution, navigate to the corresponding folder for the problem you want to solve, open the ```app.*``` file, and run it in your preferred programming environment.

Please note that some problems may require additional libraries or dependencies to be installed before the solution will work properly.
